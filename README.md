# Nuxt Plugin for IPFS Routing

## Overview

A plugin that enables nuxt routing for both the intended path and IPFS gateway URLs, which include a CID (hash) of the asset.

Enabling this plugin for Nuxt in **static mode** will allow resources, includig pages, to be accessible via two routes. For example:

- foo.com/
- gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/Qma....AbFd/

Subsequently, resources and other pages use paths relative to those bases:

- foo.com/bar
- gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/Qma....AbFd/bar

- foo.com/style.css
- gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/Qma....AbFd/style.css
